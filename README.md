Got tired of a cluttered VS Code? Me too! This repo has my super minimal `settings.json` file. It's designed for a clean, fast coding experience.

## How to Use It

It's dead simple:

1.  **Open your VS Code `settings.json` file.** (Hit `Ctrl/Cmd + ,` and click the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon).
2.  **Copy everything** from the `settings.json` file in *this* repo.
3.  **Paste it** into *your* VS Code `settings.json` file. Replace everything if you want a totally fresh start, or just pick and choose what you like.
4.  **Save**! VS Code will update instantly.

That's it. Enjoy the peace and quiet!
