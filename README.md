Tired of a messy VS Code? 😩 Me too! This repo holds my super **minimalist `settings.json`** file. It's all about giving you a clean, zippy coding environment. ✨

## How to Use It 🚀

It's literally copy-paste simple:

1.  **Open your VS Code `settings.json` file.**
    * Hit `Ctrl + ,` (or `Cmd + ,` on Mac) and click the "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in the top right. ⚙️
2.  **Copy everything** from the `settings.json` file in *this* repo. 📋
3.  **Paste it** into *your* VS Code `settings.json` file.
    * You can replace everything for a completely fresh start, or just pick and choose the bits you like to merge with your existing settings.
4.  **Save**! 💾 VS Code will update instantly.

That's it! Enjoy the peace and quiet. 🧘‍♀️ Happy coding!
